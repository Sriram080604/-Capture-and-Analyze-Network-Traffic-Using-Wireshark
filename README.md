# -Capture-and-Analyze-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark

## 📌 Objective
Capture live network packets using **Wireshark**, identify basic protocols (such as TCP, DNS, HTTP), and develop hands-on packet analysis skills.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (Free Network Protocol Analyzer)

---

## 📂 Deliverables
- ✅ Packet capture file: `network_capture.pcap`
- ✅ Short report: `protocol_analysis_report.md` / `protocol_analysis_report.pdf`

---

## 📝 Steps Performed

1. Installed **Wireshark**.
2. Started capture on the active network interface.
3. Generated traffic by:
   - Browsing websites (e.g., google.com)
   - Using `ping` command to contact external servers.
4. Stopped the capture after 1 minute.
5. Applied filters to view specific protocols:
   - `http`
   - `dns`
   - `tcp`
6. Identified **at least 3 different protocols** in the capture.
7. Exported the capture as a `.pcap` file.
8. Summarized findings in a short protocol analysis report.

## 🔍 Protocols Identified

| Protocol | Purpose                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| **TCP**  | Ensures reliable communication         |
| **DNS**  | Resolves domain names to IP addresses  |
| **HTTP** | Web browsing and content transfer      |

---

## 📌 Outcome
- Gained **hands-on experience** with packet capture and analysis.
- Understood **common network protocols** and their behavior.
- Improved **network traffic analysis** and **protocol filtering** skills using Wireshark.
